## Japan

Walking through the narrow lanes of **Gion**, I watched locals move quietly and politely, even when the streets felt crowded.  
The calm pace forced me to slow down too. I learnt to:

- **Plan less, notice more** – leaving gaps in my itinerary meant I could linger in a teahouse and sketch the wooden façades.  
- **Practise everyday respect** – a gentle bow and soft “arigatō” changed interactions with shopkeepers.

*Influence:* Since returning, I schedule short “tea breaks” in my day to pause, breathe, and reset my focus.
