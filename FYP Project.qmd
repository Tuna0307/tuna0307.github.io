## Smart Dusbin

This FPY Project was done during Polytechnic. 

### Problem

Many estate bins are emptied on a fixed timetable. Some are still half-empty when the truck arrives, while others overflow before the next round. This wastes fuel and labour.

### Solution

I designed and built a Smart Dustbin that measures how full it is and sends the data to a cloud dashboard. When the bin reaches 80 % capacity, the system alerts cleaners to pick it up.This project was dine using arduino and ESP32. The data is sent to a cloud dashboard using ThingSpeak. The system is powered by a solar panel, so it can be used in remote areas without electricity.
